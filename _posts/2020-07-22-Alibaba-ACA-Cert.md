<br>

<li>ACA Certification exam is currently priced at <b>$120</b>. Though you can obtain a voucher to take the exam <b>free of cost!</b> by attending any of the upcoming Alibaba Cloud Events.</li>
<br>
<li>ACA Exam is currently available in <b>English</b> only.</li>
<br>
<li>Due to the pandemic COVID-19, their offline test center - Pearson VUE has currently limited or suspended their testing capacity in many countries.</li>
<br>
<li>Therefore, at the time of writing this post, Alibaba Cloud is offering an interim solution by allowing candidates to take their certification exam at home via <b>Zoom video meeting</b> to accomplish online proctoring.</li>
<br>
<li>You will have <b>90 minutes</b> to complete the exam. If you do not pass the exam, and if you want to take the same certification exam again, you must have at least <b>14 days</b> gap between the 2 exams.</li>
<br>
<li>When you submit your exam, you will see the exam score <b>immediately</b>. If you pass the exam, please fill in your name to generate the certificate, be careful as once your name is submitted, it <b>cannot be modified</b>.</li>
