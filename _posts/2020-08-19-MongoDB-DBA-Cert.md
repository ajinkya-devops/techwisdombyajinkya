### About MongoDB

<p align="justify"><a href="https://www.mongodb.com/">MongoDB</a> is an <b>open-source document database</b> built on a horizontal scale-out architecture. Founded in 2007, MongoDB has a worldwide following in the developer community.

Instead of storing data in tables of rows or columns like SQL databases, each row in a MongoDB database is a document described in <b>JSON</b>, a formatting language.
</p>

<p align="justify">According to the survey conducted by <code>Scalegrid.io</code>, MongoDB ranks <b>3rd</b> among Most popular Open Source Databases & <b>1st</b> among Most Popular NoSQL Databases for year 2019.
</p>

<p align="justify">You can learn more about the Survey & check where does MongoDB stands infront of its competitors by visiting this <a href="https://scalegrid.io/blog/2019-open-source-database-report-top-databases-public-cloud-vs-on-premise-polyglot-persistence/">Survey Page</a>.
</p>

<br>

### SQL vs MongoDB

<p align="justify">The differences between MongoDB and traditional SQL-based databases are fundamental. When you use <b>Postgres</b>, <b>MySQL</b>, or <b>SQL Server</b> to power a project, you store data in a set of tables that often cross-reference one another to maintain relationships between data points.</p>

<p align="justify">MongoDB, on the other hand, doesn’t maintain these relationships. It’s a <b>non-relational</b> database, and anything you want to know about a record needs to be contained within that record itself. That said, you can choose to include data models and linking fields in your collections when creating them, but it’s up to you to enforce those models and keep links working between your MongoDB collections.
</p>

<br>

### MongoDB Certifications

<ul><ul>

<li>MongoDB certifications recognize developers and DBAs with the knowledge needed to build and maintain MongoDB applications. </li>

<br>
<li>Both of these Exams require you to have General IT Knowledge like <b>Fundamental database concepts</b>, <b>Fundamentals of system programming</b> & <b>Basic JavaScript programming</b>.</li>
<br>
<li>MongoDB currently offers certifications at the <b>Associate Level</b> for the DBA and Developer roles. Certification at other levels will be available in the future.</li>
